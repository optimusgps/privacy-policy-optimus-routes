**How long do we retain information?**

We retain personal information for the length of time necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a different retention period is requested by you or required or permitted by law. For example, we will retain your personal information for as long as it is needed to provide you with the Services or fulfill a legal or contractual obligation. Generally, we retain tracking history for one year, subject to exceptions and applicable laws. We may also aggregate or deidentify information for use in analytics, such as to analyze trends over periods of time without specifically identifying you.
We use the following criteria to determine how long we retain personal information: (a) our relationship with you, such as if there is an open contract or account, or a pending transaction or request; (b) legal obligations to retain personal information for certain purposes, such as to maintain transaction records; and (c) other obligations or considerations relating to the retention of data, such as contract requirements, litigation holds, investigations, or statutes of limitation.

**How do we protect and transfer information?**

We take efforts to employ technical, administrative, and physical security measures for personal information, taking into account reasonable security procedures and accessible technology. However, no system can be completely secure; and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. Your provision of personal information is at your own risk. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Take steps to safeguard your passwords and other data and notify us as soon as possible if you believe your account security has been breached.

**Do we sell information?**

We do not sell personal information for any monetary consideration. We may participate in targeted ads, also called online behavioral advertising, using cookies and technologies. Under some privacy legislation, this may constitute “selling” of personal information, such as for business purposes (e.g., providing our Services) and commercial purposes (e.g., other marketing). To opt out of these practices, contact us as outlined below or see our [Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information](https://optimustracker.com/pages/ccpa-opt-out) link, or equivalent, if applicable.

**What are your privacy rights?**

We value consumer privacy rights and strive to provide flexibility with how your personal data is used and shared. If you want to make a privacy request or have any questions, please contact us through our website or email us at legal@optimustracker.com with your name and email address, or other identifier used in connection with our Services so that we can verify your request. If an authorized agent is making a request on your behalf, the agent should provide its name and contact information, such as an email address, in addition to your information. There may be situations where we cannot grant your request; for example, if you make a request and we cannot verify your identity, or if you request deletion of data that we have a legal obligation to keep. Where we deny your request in whole or in part, we will take steps to inform you of the denial and provide an explanation of our actions and the reasons for the denial.
Applicable privacy laws have different requirements and depend on various factors, such as where you live and how much revenue or data is at issue. Generally, we adhere to the following set of privacy rights to the extent applicable and subject to any limitations authorized by law.
- You can access and obtain your data and ask us for certain information, including: the categories of personal information collected and used; the categories of the sources of data; the business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing data; the categories of third parties to whom data is disclosed; and the specific pieces of personal information collected. You also have a similar right to data portability (the ability to export, back up, and transfer data).
- **Amend**. You can amend, correct, or rectify your data if it is inaccurate.
- **Delete**. You can have your data deleted subject to certain legal limitations.
- You can limit the processing of your data, in particular any sensitive data.
- **Opt-Out**. You have the right to opt-out of certain data practices. For example, you can unsubscribe from marketing communications by following the opt-out instructions in each message or by contacting us as outlined in this Privacy Policy (please note that we may still send non-marketing messages, and that consent to receiving marketing communications is not mandatory to use the Service). You may also opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” or your personal information to the extent applicable. Please see our Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information link. You may opt out of the use of automated decision-making technology if applicable.
- You have the right to make certain complaints, including for privacy concerns. We value your feedback and seek the opportunity to work with you on any issues. You have the right to no discrimination for asserting your privacy rights.
- **Specific State Laws**. Several states have enacted privacy laws that may apply to you, depending on the circumstances. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), governs certain California-related conduct. Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents may also request certain information regarding our sharing personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Further, if you are a California resident under the age of 18, California Business & Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content you have publicly posted (but does not ensure complete removal of public content).
- **Other Laws**. Depending on where you live, you may have the right to access your own information that we hold; to ask that your information be corrected, updated, or erased; and the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing of your information. Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal data is your consent, the fulfillment of our obligations pursuant to the contract created between you and us, or where the collection and use is in our legitimate interests and does not violate your data protection interests or fundamental rights. You may withdraw your consent to our collection and use of your personal data. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your information used in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. If certain other privacy laws apply to you that provide you with additional rights, please contact us to make a request.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Optimus GPS Tracking Corp will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Optimus GPS Tracking Corp cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges.

Optimus GPS Tracking Corp accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for the both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Optimus GPS Tracking Corp does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
